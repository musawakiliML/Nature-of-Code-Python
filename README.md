# Nature-of-Code-Python

Reimplement all examples and projects from The Nature of Code in Python

## 🌱 Overview

This repository contains Python reimplementations of examples from The Nature of Code by Daniel Shiffman. The goal is to translate all JavaScript-based examples into Python while maintaining accuracy and readability.

## 📌 Project Goals

- Reimplement all examples from the book using Python.

- Provide interactive Jupyter notebooks for learning.

- Use libraries like pygame, matplotlib, and numpy for visualization.

- Maintain structured, well-documented code for easy understanding.
